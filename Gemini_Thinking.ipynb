        "# Exploring Gemini Thinking with Structured Prompts and Google Search\n",
        "\n",
        "This Python script demonstrates how to use Google's Gemini AI models (like Gemini 2.5 Flash) to generate structured content about a specific subject. It utilizes a detailed prompt template **based on techniques recommended by Google for guiding the AI's thinking process (see [Google AI Thinking Prompt Guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking#prompt-guide)) and leverages the Google Search tool to enable the AI to perform research and present information in a predefined format.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Here's how it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setup:**\n",
        "    *   It configures your Gemini API key (essential for using the AI). You'll need to set this up beforehand.\n",
        "    *   It defines a \"Google Search Tool,\" allowing the AI to actively search the internet for information.\n",
        "2.  **The Prompt:**\n",
        "    *   It uses a detailed prompt template that tells the AI exactly what kind of output we want.  This prompt asks the AI to:\n",
        "        *   Research a topic (e.g., \"3 famous female brazilian scientists\").\n",
        "        *   Identify key figures in that topic.\n",
        "        *   Summarize their contributions.\n",
        "        *   Present the information in a well-organized list.\n",
        "3.  **Inserting the Topic:**\n",
        "    *   We define a variable called `subject` with the specific topic we want the AI to focus on.  The code then inserts this topic into the prompt template, replacing a placeholder.\n",
        "4.  **Calling the AI:**\n",
        "    *   It initializes the Gemini AI model, linking it to the Google Search tool.\n",
        "    *   It then sends the complete prompt to the AI. The prompt tells the AI to do research, analyze the results, and structure the output.\n",
        "5.  **Getting the Results:**\n",
        "    *   Finally, the code prints the generated content from the AI, which should be a structured summary of the key figures in the specified topic, complete with their contributions and brief descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why this is useful:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Structured Output:**  The detailed prompt ensures that the AI generates content in a predictable format, making it easier to use and process.\n",
        "*   **Research-Driven:**  The Google Search tool empowers the AI to go beyond its internal knowledge and find up-to-date information.\n",
        "*   **Customizable:**  You can easily change the `subject` variable to generate content about different topics, all while maintaining the same structured format.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Key Code Snippets:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `genai.configure(api_key=...)`:  Sets up the API key.\n",
        "*   `google_search_tool`: Defines the Google Search tool.\n",
        "*   `prompt_template.replace(\"{{SUBJECT}}\", subject)`: Inserts the topic into the prompt.\n",
        "*   `model.generate_content(contents=...)`: Sends the prompt to the AI and generates the content.\n",
        "*   `response.text`:  Contains the generated text from the AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code is a powerful example of how you can combine AI models with structured prompts and external tools to create informative and well-organized content.  Experiment with different prompts and topics to see what you can create!\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember to install the necessary libraries and configure your API key before running the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
